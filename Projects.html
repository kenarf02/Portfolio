                Holo Knights TD is a game made during my internship in Apptimia. It was made in unity3D and MRTK for
                microsoft hololens2. It is a fully playable tower defense game with all available AR features as well
                as:
                placing and upgrading various towers, randomly generated maps and enemy spawns, status effects (slow,
                burn) and many more.

                Boing boing ball is my most recent, soon-to-be-released mobile game. It is a one-tap, physics-based
                adventure through colorful, yet simple and elegant worlds. The player's task is to launch a ball through
                the level to reach the flag and collect the stars. It is my proudest attempt to make a mobile game, it
                taught me more about level design than programming, however, it was a good try to make something fun,
                playing with ideas and making up simple mechanics.

                Barry and the zombies is a top-down roguelike game. The player finds himself in a base full of dangerous
                enemies, traps, and bosses. One's main goal is to explore and find out where did the zombies come from.
                In the game, one can find a multitude of items, such as weapons, usable items with a variety of
                different effects, and passive items, granting bonuses for the player. "Barry and the zombies" is my
                best game project so far, which taught me a lot when it comes to game design and programming. It has
                been played by a total of 50 players. The game was made entirely in Unity3D engine and programmed in C#.
                Every game experience is
                different because of procedural room generation as well as placement of the enemies and items. Download
                <a href="https://kenarf.itch.io/barry-the-zombies">here</a>. The code can be found on my github.

                Hack and slash project is a small RPG/hack and slash project (prototype) made in order to prove to
                myself I can build a fully functional RPG game using unity. It consists of a fighting system, a questing
                system, a dialogue system, and much more. The work is currently suspended and it will not be developed
                into a full product, yet was a great learning opportunity for me and to build up my self-esteem. It
                taught me to manage my code better and many important things concerning OOP in C#. The code can be found
                on my github and the devlog conducted weekly can be found <a href="https://kenarf.itch.io/hns">here</a>.
