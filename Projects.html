                    Barry and the zombies is a top-down roguelike game. The player finds himself in a base full of dangerous enemies, traps, and bosses. One's main goal is to explore and find out where did the zombies come from. In the game, one can find a multitude of items, such as weapons, usable items with a variety of different effects, and passive items, granting bonuses for the player. "Barry and the zombies" is my best game project so far, which taught me a lot when it comes to game design and programming. It has been played by a total of 50 players. The game was made entirely in Unity3D engine and programmed in C#. Every game experience is 
                    different because of procedural room generation as well as placement of the enemies and items. Download <a href="https://kenarf.itch.io/barry-the-zombies">here</a>. The code can be found on my github.

                    Hack and slash project is a small RPG/hack and slash project (prototype) made in order to prove to myself I can build a fully functional RPG game using unity. It consists of a fighting system, a questing system, a dialogue system, and much more. The work is currently suspended and it will not be developed into a full product, yet was a great learning opportunity for me and to build up my self-esteem. It taught me to manage my code better and many important things concerning OOP in C#. The code can be found on my github and the devlog conducted weekly can be found <a href="https://kenarf.itch.io/hns">here</a>.
